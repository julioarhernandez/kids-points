## What I have use?

This project is a demonstration of how I use the new React approach to build apps using **Hooks**. All components are functional components whe may be using *useState* for local state management. 

I am also using *useRef*  for a particular case where you need to keep track of previous state.

For a more centralized state management I'm using **Redux** and specially the *useSelector* and *useDispatch* hooks provided in recent versions.
